1. A **Gacha machine** that facilitates pulling of characters and weapons
2. **Characters** that are used to combat enemies; duplicate characters may be
merged together so they may be refined
3. **Weapons** that give characters additional power; duplicate weapons may be
merged together so they may be refined
4. **Resources** which are used to level both characters and weapons
5. **Enemies** that characters can defeat, which yields resources
6. **Maps** where different kinds of enemies are found
7. Other managers that facilitate **merging, levelling, combat and exploration**.
